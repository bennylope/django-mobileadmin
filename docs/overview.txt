===========================================================
The Django admin interface optimized for iPhone/iPod touch.
===========================================================

This is an alternative admin interface for Django for use with the iPhone/iPod
touch. Some would call it a theme or a skin, but actually it's more than that.
Well, actually it misses some functionality of the normal admin interface.
Anyway, it is automatically used for any request which comes from a
MobileSafari based device by using a nifty midlleware/template construct.

Hope you like it, Jannis.

Installation
============

Get the source from the application site at::

    http://code.google.com/p/django-mobileadmin/

To install the mobileadmin app, follow these steps:

    1. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL.txt file
    2. Add ``'mobileadmin'`` to your INSTALLED_APPS_ setting.
    3. Make sure ``'mobileadmin.loader.load_template_source'`` is in your
       TEMPLATE_LOADERS_ setting at the first position.
    4. Make sure ``'mobileadmin.middleware.MobileAdminMiddleware'`` is in your
       MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES_ setting on the last position (or the position before
       the last if you have installed the flat pages contrib app and its 
       ``FlatpageFallbackMiddleware``)
    5. Make sure the MOBILEADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX setting is set to the URL prefix
       for the mobileadmin media -- CSS, Javascript and images. Just like the
       ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX_ but for the ``media`` directory of the mobileadmin app.
       Please use a trailing slash.
    6. Make sure you've installed the admin contrib app.
