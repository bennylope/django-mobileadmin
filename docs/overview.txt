===========================================================
The Django admin interface optimized for iPhone/iPod touch.
===========================================================

This is an alternative admin interface for Django for use with the iPhone/iPod
touch. Some would call it a theme or a skin, but actually it's more than that.
It resembles almost all features of the normal Django admin interface and is
automatically used for any request which comes from a MobileSafari based
device by using a nifty midlleware/template construct.

Hope you like it, Jannis.

Installation
============

Get the source from the application site at::

    http://code.google.com/p/django-mobileadmin/

To install the mobileadmin app, follow these steps:

    1. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL.txt file
    2. Add ``'mobileadmin'`` to your INSTALLED_APPS_ setting.
    3. Make sure ``'mobileadmin.loader.load_template_source'`` is in your
       TEMPLATE_LOADERS_ setting at the first position.
    4. Make sure ``'mobileadmin.middleware.MobileAdminMiddleware'`` is in your
       MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES_ setting on the last position (or the position before
       the last if you have installed the flat pages contrib app and its 
       ``FlatpageFallbackMiddleware``)
    5. Make sure you've installed the admin contrib app.

Media path
==========

Please feel free to use some nice little helpers to find the path to mobileadmin's
media directory. If you are using Django (or any other Python software) to
serve static files (which you shouldn't in production) just use for example::

    from mobileadmin.conf import settings

    mobileadmin_media_path = settings.MEDIA_PATH
    mobileadmin_media_prefix = settings.MEDIA_PREFIX

You now have the full (platform-independent) path to the media directory of
mobileadmin in the variable ``mobileadmin_media_path`` and the default URL
prefix (``'/mobileadmin_media/'``) for the mobileadmin media -- CSS, Javascript
and images -- in ``mobileadmin_media_prefix``. Just like the
ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX_ but for the ``media`` directory of the mobileadmin app.

You can of course optionally override the default URL prefix by setting
a ``MOBILEADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX`` in the settings.py file of your Django site.
Please use a trailing slash. This makes updating mobileadmin much easier for
you, since you now don't have to bother about different locations of the media
directory. 

Serving mobileadmin's static media with Django
---------------------------------------------- 

Even though using Django's ability to serve static files is strongly **not
recommended** for live production servers, it might be helpful to bring up
mobileadmin for a test drive or an intranet website. Just add the following
code to the URLConf (``urls.py``) of your Django site::

    from mobileadmin.conf import settings
    
    urlpatterns += patterns('django.views.static',
        (settings.MEDIA_REGEX, 'serve', {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_PATH}),
    )

See how mobileadmin's own settings module is loaded at the top of the snippet
that enables you to obtain a ready-made regex for the static files
(``MEDIA_REGEX``) and the platform-independent filesystem path to the media
files (``MEDIA_PATH``).
