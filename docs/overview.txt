===========================================================
The Django admin interface optimized for iPhone/iPod touch.
===========================================================

This is an alternative admin interface for Django for use with the iPhone/iPod
touch. Some would call it a theme or a skin, but actually it's more than that.
It resembles almost all features of the normal Django admin interface and is
automatically used for any request which comes from a MobileSafari based
device by using a nifty midlleware/template construct.

Hope you like it, Jannis.

Installation
============

Get the source from the application site at::

    http://code.google.com/p/django-mobileadmin/

To install the mobileadmin app, follow these steps:

    1. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL.txt file
    2. Add ``'mobileadmin'`` to your INSTALLED_APPS_ setting.
    3. Make sure ``'mobileadmin.loader.load_template_source'`` is in your
       TEMPLATE_LOADERS_ setting at the first position.
    4. Make sure ``'mobileadmin.middleware.MobileAdminMiddleware'`` is in your
       MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES_ setting on the last position (or the position before
       the last if you have installed the flat pages contrib app and its 
       ``FlatpageFallbackMiddleware``)
    5. Make sure the MOBILEADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX setting is set to the URL prefix
       for the mobileadmin media -- CSS, Javascript and images. Just like the
       ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX_ but for the ``media`` directory of the mobileadmin app.
       Please use a trailing slash.
    6. Make sure you've installed the admin contrib app.

Media path
==========

Please feel free to use a nice little helper to find the path to mobileadmin's
media directory. If you are using Django (or any other Python software) to
serve static files (which you shouldn't in production) just use::

    ``from mobileadmin import MOBILEADMIN_MEDIA_PATH``

You now have the full (platform-independent) path to the media directory of
mobileadmin in the variable ``MOBILEADMIN_MEDIA_PATH``. This makes updating
mobileadmin much easier for you, since you now don't have to bother about
different locations of the media directory.
